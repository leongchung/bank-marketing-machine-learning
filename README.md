# Overview

The objective of the bank marketing dataset is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various demographic, financial, and campaign-related features. This prediction helps the bank target potential customers more effectively by identifying those who are more likely to respond positively to marketing efforts, ultimately improving marketing efficiency and increasing subscription rates.
